# Expense-tracker
The Expense Tracker project is aimed at providing a convenient tool for tracking personal or household expenses. The web application is designed to streamline the process of budget management, offering a user-friendly interface, automation of calculations, and reports and insights.

## Problem
In today's fast-paced world, managing personal or household expenses can be a challenging task. Traditional methods of budget tracking, such as recording expenses in a notebook or spreadsheet, can be insufficient or cumbersome. These manual methods can make it difficult to track expenses accurately, and the time and effort required can be significant. Additionally, manual methods offer limited integration with other financial tools, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive view of one's financial situation.
